# Must-have
- TODOs and FIXMEs
	- Proper implementation of changing attribute types.
		- Special treatment of 'DataType' attribute type.
	- Make call to server when adding/changing/removing model input/output
	- Update all_tensors global when adding new tensor.

# Other
- Add support for advanced edits in server & client
	- Shape inference
	- Add validation using ONNX runtime
		- If error exists, it is reported in the GUI.
	- Reorder Node/Model inputs/outputs
- TODOs and FIXMEs
	- Allow creation of new tensors instead of selecting from drop-down.
		- Especially for output tensors
	- Faster visual graph updates when nodes are added/removed
		- Probably involves adding new methods to grapher.js
		- Don't show spinny wheel when a node is removed.
	- Center on edited node after refreshing graph when editing inputs/outputs.
	- Allow creating initializers for tensor inputs.
	- Refactor view.js to remove duplicate code etc
- Smarter ONNX ops
	- When changing a node op, automatically create attributes/inputs to match.
